===

PAW is a Php Application Webserver.

Since it's not yet packaged for any distros (TODO) there is an install script that needs to be run as a super user.
[user@host lib]$ sudo ./install

Starting, stopping & checking on service status:
[user@host lib]$ sudo service paw start
[user@host lib]$ sudo service paw stop
[user@host lib]$ sudo service paw status
